## Short Answer Q&A - Include short answers to the following questions,
1. Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)

The domain name system (DNS) was established in 1984 and network adresses were identifed by extensions such as .com .org. In 1989 Tim Berners-Lee developes the Hypertext, creating www. the world wide web. The term BLOG was first coined as WEB BLOG in 1997 following July 8th when a NASA website broadcasted images taken on Mars, google opened their first office one year later, napster and myspace in 1999.
