## Short Answer Q&A - Include short answers to the following questions,
1. Describe key events in the development of the internet from the 1980s to today (max. 150 words)

The domain name system (DNS) was established in 1984 and network adresses were identifed by extensions such as .com .org. In 1989 Tim Berners-Lee developes the Hypertext, creating www. the world wide web. The term BLOG was first coined as WEB BLOG in 1997 following July 8th when a NASA website broadcasted images taken on Mars, google opened their first office one year later, napster and myspace in 1999. 
2003 was a big year for the internet whith spam emails accounting to half of all emails, Apple introduces itunes, the cost of a song is 99c, not exacty stopping the 2.6 billion illegally downloaded music files being downloaded each month. Facebook was founded in 2004 by Mark Zuckerberg and youtube was launched, by 2006 there are more than 100 million websites online. Today there are 1.8 billion websites in the world. 

2.  Define and describes the relationship between fundamental aspects of the internet such as: domains, web servers, DNS, and web browsers (max. 150 words)

A web server is a program that uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to process and send web pages to a user in response to a user request. Domains are the network adresses that share a common suffix such as .com or .edu marking them for the users recognition. Web browsers are the software organisations used to access the world wide web, Internet explorer and google chrome are these such browers. The thing connecting all of these aspects is a user; we jump on a browser, type in a domain name such as facebook.com a web server finds this and we recieve it on our computer. 

3.  Reflect on one aspect of the development of internet technologies and how it has contributed to the world today (max. 150 words)

contributions such as the accessability of the internet, it's now in your pocket, you can find an answer to a question in no time at all, are what makes living today a lot less complicated. To be entertained even on your comute to work or when your sister steals the tv remote, it's all good because you have the app on your phone.
